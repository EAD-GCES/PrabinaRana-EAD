Government Enterprise Architecture Framework(GEAFs)

A government enterprise is a coordinated set of activity areas involving one or more public institutions, as well as third-party groups from the business sector or civil society. By promoting interoperability and reuse of standard components, a government-wide enterprise architecture will enable the government to cut development and operations costs while also enhancing overall quality.
